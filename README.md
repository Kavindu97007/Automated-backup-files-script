-----Task: Automated Backup Script-----

This Shell script does the following:

* Creates a backup directory (backup_dir) if it doesnâ€™t exist.

* Copies all .txt files from the current directory to backup_dir.

* Appends a timestamp to the copied files (e.g., file_20240304.txt).

* Logs the names of copied files into backup_log.txt.

* Displays a message showing how many files were backed up.
